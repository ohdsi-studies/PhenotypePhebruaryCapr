# Phenotype Phebruary Day 1 â€“ Type 2 diabetes mellitus

# Notes: 

# Patrick Ryan developed three Type 2 diabetes definitions for day 1

# The frist is a simple definition.
# People entering at the first condition occurrence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus excluding T1DM and secondary) with at least 365 days of prior continuous observation

# The second definition adds two additional inclusion criteria.
# 1) no prior type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2) no secondary diabetes mellitus

# The third definition adds three additional possible entry events and one inclusion criteria.
# People enter cohort 3 on a T2DM diagnosis or a diabetes drug exposure (excluding insulin), or an HbA1c measurement (using two possible units)


# We can reuse the parts of each prior cohort in the next one.

# Frist set up a connection to a CDM database
# devtools::install_github("OHDSI/Capr")
